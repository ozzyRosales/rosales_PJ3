# Dream Fest: Celebrating Daca 
By Oscar Rosales,
Spring 2024


# Project Overview
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has empowered over half a million immigrant youths, granting them the opportunity to chase their dreams in the United States. Thanks to the employment authorizations provided by DACA, 90% of these recipients are employed. Moreover, one-third of all immigrant students in the U.S. are DACA recipients. However, recent years have seen the program in a state of uncertainty, with a halt to new applications and ambiguous future support. This instability has led to heightened anxiety and fear among participants, who must renew their status every two years.


This webpage is dedicated to Dream Fest: Celebrating DACA, a festival designed to educate, advocate, support, and unite people in support of DACA recipients. Dream Fest is a collaborative effort with the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation (CRLAF) and aims to attract a broad audience, including community supporters, advocates, students, educators, DACA recipients and their families, legal professionals, advocacy groups, and anyone interested in learning about and supporting DACA.


Dream Fest is a three-day event simultaneously held in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, fostering a statewide network of support. The festival kicks off with a vibrant cultural celebration, featuring performances by Latin artists, musicians, and dancers, highlighting the rich immigrant tapestry of America. The event begins with an interactive art installation where attendees can contribute to a collective artwork symbolizing hope and unity, which will grow throughout the festival. The second day includes raffles with prizes such as school supplies, computers, and gift cards. The festival concludes with a panel discussion titled "Voices of DACA: Stories of Resilience and Hope," where DACA recipients from diverse sectors like education, law, business, and the arts will discuss their personal stories and the obstacles they have surmounted. This discussion seeks to personalize the DACA debate, provide impactful stories, and forge emotional connections with the audience. The event will wrap up with a keynote speech from a prominent DACA or immigrant rights advocate, such as a distinguished lawmaker, activist, or public intellectual.
